Radiohead is an English alternative-rock band known mostly for their use of experimental soundscapes and abtract lyricism knowadays, but this wasn't always the case. Before the release of their third commercial album "OK Computer" in 1997, Radiohead made more guitar-centered, lyrically introspective music. OK Computer is largely believed to have laid the groundwork for their later, more experimental albums such as "Kid A" and "Hail to the Thief". But was this album really so groundbreaking for the band, or were there signs of more experimental interests within the bands earlier albums, when analysing them in Spotify? Or is it possible that Spotify altered some labels/genres because of the image Radiohead had already acquired before Spotify released in the first place? Looking at the audio feature for each of their albums, I hope to be able to showcase the change in Radioheads music throughout the years.
